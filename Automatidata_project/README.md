## 1. Dataset
- These records are generated from the trip record submissions made by yellow taxi Technology Service Providers (TSPs). Each row represents a single trip in a yellow taxi. The trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off taxi zone locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.

## 1.  Project scenario
- Luana Rodriquez, the senior data analyst at Automatidata, is pleased with the work you have already completed and requests your assistance with some EDA and data visualization work for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission project (New York City TLC) to get a general understanding of what taxi ridership looks like. The management team is asking for **a Python notebook showing data structuring and cleaning, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations plotted to help understand the data**. At the very least, include a box plot of the ride durations and some time series plots, like a breakdown by quarter or month.

- Additionally, the management team has recently asked all EDA to include Tableau visualizations. For this taxi data, **create a Tableau dashboard showing a New York City map of taxi/limo trips by month**. Make sure it is easy to understand to someone who isnâ€™t data savvy, and remember that the assistant director at the New York City TLC is a person with visual impairments.
